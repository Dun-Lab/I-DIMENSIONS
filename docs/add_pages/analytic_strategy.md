# Analytic strategy
In this project, we aim to perform an integrative analysis of multi-omics data to uncover crucial biological insights. Initially, we will utilize DNA methylation analysis to gain preliminary insights into transcription and translation processes. We plan to employ generative AI or linear models to reconstruct methylation profiles, which will facilitate subgroup identification through consensus clustering.

Subsequently, we will leverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to obtain a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape by the pipeline from DKFZ ICGC project, focusing on understanding mutational signatures in DMG and identifying subgroup-specific driver genes and functional pathways.
In addition to these (epi-)genomic approaches, we will harness H&E imaging to reveal tissue microscopic structures. Deep learning-based cell segmentation and classification from H&E images will aid in pathological assessment, thereby refining subgroup classifications initially identified through methylation profiles.

Moreover, integrating proteomics and phospho-proteomics with pathway analysis will enhance our understanding of biological pathways implicated in the project. Specifically, we will conduct pathway analysis on differentially expressed proteins identified through proteomic data, facilitating insights into potential drug targets.

By combining these diverse analytical approaches, our project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of biological mechanisms underlying DMG, leading to potential advancements in therapeutic strategies.

# Hypothesis
The hypothesis of I-DIMENSIONS is to integrate DNA methylation and H&E imaging to accurately classify DMG subtypes, thereby providing data-driven decision support. To validate the hypothesis, I have four aims to make it happen: 

* Aim 1: Identify subgroups from DNA methylation profiles of over 200 DMG samples by machine learning algorithms.
* Aim 2: Leverage WGS data to analyse mutational signatures operative in DMG and identify subgroup-specific drivers and pathways. 
* Aim 3: Integrate H&E imaging with pattern recognition and pathological diagnosis to re-evaluate methylation profiles-based classification.
* Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive DMG subtyping system that incorporates all analytical methods within three aims.

By achieving these aims, we will be able to make significant progress in classifying DMG subtypes and providing accurate, robust and data-driven decision support for clinical applications.
