<h1 id="analytic-strategy">Analytic strategy</h1>
<p>In this project, we aim to perform an integrative analysis of
multi-omics data to uncover crucial biological insights. Initially, we
will utilize DNA methylation analysis to gain preliminary insights into
transcription and translation processes. We plan to employ generative AI
or linear models to reconstruct methylation profiles, which will
facilitate subgroup identification through consensus clustering.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we will leverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to
obtain a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape by the pipeline
from DKFZ ICGC project, focusing on understanding mutational signatures
in DMG and identifying subgroup-specific driver genes and functional
pathways. In addition to these (epi-)genomic approaches, we will harness
H&amp;E imaging to reveal tissue microscopic structures. Deep
learning-based cell segmentation and classification from H&amp;E images
will aid in pathological assessment, thereby refining subgroup
classifications initially identified through methylation profiles.</p>
<p>Moreover, integrating proteomics and phospho-proteomics with pathway
analysis will enhance our understanding of biological pathways
implicated in the project. Specifically, we will conduct pathway
analysis on differentially expressed proteins identified through
proteomic data, facilitating insights into potential drug targets.</p>
<p>By combining these diverse analytical approaches, our project aims to
provide a comprehensive understanding of biological mechanisms
underlying DMG, leading to potential advancements in therapeutic
strategies.</p>
<h1 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h1>
<p>The hypothesis of I-DIMENSIONS is to integrate DNA methylation and
H&amp;E imaging to accurately classify DMG subtypes, thereby providing
data-driven decision support. To validate the hypothesis, I have four
aims to make it happen: </p>
<p> Aim 1: Identify subgroups from DNA methylation
profiles of over 200 DMG samples by machine learning algorithms. </p>
<p> Aim2: Leverage WGS data to analyse mutational signatures operative in DMG
and identify subgroup-specific drivers and pathways. </p>
<p> Aim 3: Integrate H&amp;E imaging with pattern recognition and pathological diagnosis to
re-evaluate methylation profiles-based classification. </p>
<p> Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive DMG subtyping system that incorporates all analytical
methods within three aims.</p>
<p>By achieving these aims, we will be able to make significant progress
in classifying DMG subtypes and providing accurate, robust and
data-driven decision support for clinical applications.</p>
