What is DNA methylation?
DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to a CG dinucleotide of the DNA. Methylation profiles are the most extensively studied epigeneetic mark.

How to present the methylation profiles?
Methylation profiles are made up of CpG sites. CpG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its 5' -> 3' direction.
For each CpG, there are two measurements: a methylated intensity (M) and an unmethylated intensity (U). These intensity values can be used to determine the proportion of methylation at each CpG locus. 
Methylation levels can be reported as two format:
Beta values = M / (M + U) + a, a = 100.
M values = log2(M / U).
