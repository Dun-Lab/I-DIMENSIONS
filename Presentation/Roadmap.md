# Logic thinking
* What is the question in my literature review?
    * How to accurately classify the DMG subtypes from DNA methylation, whole genome sequencing and H&E imaging?
* What has been written on the topic?
  * Existing work have used linear and non-linear model to classify the DMG subtypes.
* Are there any gaps in the literature that require further study?
  * The insufficient public data leads the shallow understanding of machanism DMG.
  * How to better recognise the pattern from the given multi-modalities.

# Structure of a literature review
## Introduction
* Why I write this review and why this topic is important.
  * The DMG is a high-risk and complex brain cancer but we have limited understanding of it.
  * This review could provide a systematic summary of existing work about DMG, and identify research gaps to encourage researchers to further study them.
* The scope of the review
  * This review will be focused on the DMG. But the successful solution in other brain cancer will be referred to gain common insights.
* The criteria used for your literature selection
  * Collect high-impact literatures from the internet in past decades.
