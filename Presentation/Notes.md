* Title 
  * Aberrant ERBB4-SRC Signaling as a Hallmark of Group 4 Medulloblastoma Revealed by Integrative Phosphoproteomic Profiling
* Key findings
  * Identification of highly divergent oncogenic signaling pathway regulation ERBB4-SRC in group 4 MBs.
  * Phosphoproteomic profiles reveal that expression of an activated SRC
  * combined with p53 inactivation induces murine tumors that resemble group 4 MB.
* Analytic strategy
  * Clustering the DNA methylation, RNA-seq, proteomic and phosphoprotemoic individualy.
  * Using similarity network link four modalities then clustering again.
  * Differential analysis for the ratio of relative expression between protein and mRNA.
  * Using gene set enrichment analysis to assess the reason of inconsistence distribution between mRNA and proteomic.
