* Title 
  * Aberrant ERBB4-SRC Signaling as a Hallmark of Group 4 Medulloblastoma Revealed by Integrative Phosphoproteomic Profiling
* Key findings
  * Identification of highly divergent oncogenic signaling pathway regulation ERBB4-SRC in group 4 MBs.
  * Phosphoprosteomic profiles reveal that expression of an activated SRC
  * combined with p53 inactivation induces murine tumors that resemble group 4 MB.
* Analytic strategy
  * Clustering the DNA methylation, RNA-seq, proteomic and phosphoprotemoic individualy.
  * Using similarity network link four modalities then clustering again.
  * Differential analysis for the ratio of relative expression between protein and mRNA.
  * Using gene set enrichment analysis to assess the reason of inconsistence distribution between mRNA and proteomic.
  
* Title
  * DNA methylation landscapes in DIPG reveal methylome variability that can be modified pharmacologically
* Key findings
  * We generate comprehensive maps of the dynamic DNA methylation landscape in DIPG that captures epigenetic variation.
  * DIPG has a markedly disordered epigenome, with increasingly stochastic (random) DNA methylation localizing to key regulatory elements and genes. 
  * The DIPG methylation landscape can be modified with hypomethylating drugs to constrain plasticity, alter gene expression, and induce immune signaling.
* Analytic strategy
  * Quantify DNA methylation stochasticity by assessing the joint probability distribution of DNA methylation levels across WGBS reads using the Ising model of statistical physics.
  * The shannon's entropy is used to measure the stochasticity. And the Jensen-shannon's distance is used to measure the distance between two probability distribution (test vs control).
  * Identify key pathways using gene set within increased methylation stochasticity.

* Title
  * DNA methylation-based classification of central nervous system tumours
* Benefits of DNA methylation profiling
  * The cancer methylome is a combination of both somatically acquired DNA methylation changes and characteristics that reflect the cell of origin.
  * The tracing of the primary site of highly dedifferentiated metastase of cancers of unknown origin.
  * DNA methylation profiling is highly robust and reproducible even from small samples and poor quality material.
  * It is widely used to subclassify CNS tumours that were previously considered homogeneous diseases.
* Key issues they aim to address
  * Substantial inter-observer variability in the histopathological diagnosis of many CNS tumours.
  * Classifier application in routine diagnostics requires fast and reproducible classification of samples as well as a measure of confidence for the specific call.
